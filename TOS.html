        <h1>Terms of Service (TOS) â€“ Nenyooo Store</h1>
        <p>By purchasing, downloading, or using any products sold through Nenyooo Store (including Nenyooo, Infamous, and Riptide), you fully agree to the following Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must not purchase, download, or use our products.</p>

        <h2>1. Product Access and Usage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We reserve the right to ban, suspend, or permanently terminate your product key and account at any time without prior notice if you are found in violation of our terms.</li>
            <li>Lifetime access means the lifetime of the product, not your lifetime. Products can be shut down, discontinued, or retired at any time without compensation.</li>
            <li>Unauthorized distribution, sharing, reselling, or leaking of your product key is strictly prohibited and will result in an instant ban.</li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to keep your product key safe. Lost, stolen, or shared keys will not be replaced. Sharing your key will result in a ban.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Payment and Fraud Protection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We reserve the right to decline, hold, or cancel any payment flagged as suspicious, fraudulent, or high-risk.</li>
            <li>If your payment is flagged, you will not receive your product key. The payment may be held or refunded to the card owner.</li>
            <li>Chargebacks are strictly prohibited. Any chargeback will result in a permanent ban of your product key and blacklisting from future services.</li>
            <li>Threatening a chargeback will result in an instant ban.</li>
            <li>All purchases are logged and secured with transaction records, IP address, and device information to be used as evidence against fraudulent chargebacks.</li>
            <li>Attempting a chargeback after agreeing to these terms is considered a breach of contract and fraudulent activity. We will submit all logs, communications, and user agreements as proof to the payment processor to contest chargebacks.</li>
            <li>Users who attempt a chargeback agree to forfeit all future access to Nenyooo Store and its associated services permanently.</li>
            <li>Providing fake payment information such as a false name, billing address, or contact details will result in the order being placed on hold for manual review. We will require a valid reason for the fake information and proof of card ownership. This proof must include a clear image of the card showing the last four digits and the cardholder's name, with all other sensitive information hidden.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Cryptocurrency Payments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cryptocurrency payments are final and cannot be reversed, refunded, or disputed.</li>

            <li>We are not responsible for payments sent to the wrong address, incorrect payment amounts, or network fee issues.</li>
            <li>Failure to cover transaction fees on the blockchain will result in an incomplete payment, and your product key will not be delivered.</li>
            <li>If you send less than the required amount or fail to cover network fees, your order will be invalid, and no compensation or product key will be provided.</li>
